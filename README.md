# AppMore
Auto-extend app's description in AppStore updates

## Features
The tweak auto-expands the description of apps in the update page of the AppStore on iOS 13. It works for both updated apps and outdated ones.
This tweak has been made after [a Reddit request](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/iy4tk8/question_is_there_a_tweak_that_expands_the_more/).

## Known issues
Not really an issue, but the actual way makes the auto-extend a bit laggy, although is has been optimized to avoid duplicate/useless calls. It might be fixed in a future update(/rewrite?).

## Installation
### Method 1
The tweak is available on your favorite package manager in [my repository](https://redentic.dev).

### Method 2
Clone this repository, and type in terminal `make package` from the folder of this repository.
